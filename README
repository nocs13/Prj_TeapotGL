USING:
As program is very simple it had not many controls. For use you need to do several steps using menu bar.
1. File>Model. It will load teapot model as resource in scene, but it not appear in scene.
2. Scene>Insert. It will add loaded mesh in scene and you will see teapot.
3. Scene>Explode. It does explode simulation which takes 3 second and after tepot will appear again.

Ctrl+MouseMove is for move camera at teapot.

NOTE:
If by some reason you are unable to use mingw and Dev-C++ you can convert file Prj_TeapotGL to
Prj_TeapotGL.exe and run to see example. File Prj_TeapotGL is located in project folder.
